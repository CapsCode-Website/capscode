## Difference between SLICE & SPLICE in JavaScript

Hello Devs,

In this article, we will discuss what's the difference between the two most important methods of Array in JavaScript (i.e Slice and Splice)

The `splice()` method

- returns the removed items in an array.

The `slice()` method

- returns the selected element(s) in an array, as a new array object.

The `splice()` method

- changes the original array but

`slice()` method

- doesnâ€™t change the original array.

Lets see some of the simple examples to get the small clarification.

```js
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr1.splice(1, 3); //returns [2, 3, 4]
console.log(arr1); //[1, 5]

arr2.slice(1, 3); //returns [2, 3]
console.log(arr2); //[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Lets discuss these two methods in more details.

### First we will discuss the splice method in detail.

Syntax:

```js
splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...itemN);
```

where,
**start (required)** -> where you want to start editing the array.

- if start is not provided then empty array is returned and it will not affect the original array
- If start is greater than length of array then start will set to length of an array.
- If negative then it is treated as **array.length-start** and if now the negative value will come then treat it as 0

**deleteCount(optional)** -> number of element you want to delete from **_start_** index

- if it is not provided or greater than or equal to array.length then all the element from start to end of an array is deleted.
- If `deleteCount` is `0` or negative, no elements will be deleted.

- **item1, item2...itemN(optional)** ->The elements to add to the array, beginning from **_start_**.
- If you do not specify any elements, `splice()` will only remove elements from the array.

lets see some of examples.

```js
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
a.splice(); //[]
console.log(a); // [1,2,3,4,5]

let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
a.splice(2); //returns [3,4,5]
console.log(a); //[1,2]

let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
a.splice(-3); //returns [3,4,5], here start is treated as array.length-start
console.log(a); //[1,2]

let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
a.splice(-7); //returns [1,2,3,4,5], here start is treated as array.length-start and this is ngative so start will now be treated as 0
console.log(a); //[]
//(an empty array)

let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
a.splice(2, 9); //returns [3,4,5]
console.log(a); //[1,2]

let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
a.splice(2, 2, "a", "b", "c", "d"); //returns [3, 4]
console.log(a); //[1, 2, "a", "b", "c", "d", 5]
//slice has removed 2 elements starting from index '2' and added the item1, item2, ...itemN at start positon

//This also very useful when you want to delete a specific element from an array
let arr =[1,3,6,4]
//we want to remove 3 from array
const index = arr.indexOf(3) //returns 1
//NOTE: indexOf returns -1 if element is not present in an array and it returns the index of 1st occurrence of that element and its case-sensitive (useful when we are searching a word in string)
if(index > -1){
  arr.splice(index, 1)
}
console.log(arr) // [1,6,4]
```

### Now lets discuss the slice method.

This method just extract the a part from an array.

Syntax:

```js
slice(start, end);
```

where,
**start(required)** -> starting index from where to start the extraction from an array.

- if the value of start is negative then it is treated as arr.length-1
- if `start` is undefined, `slice` starts from the index `0`.
- if start is greater than length of an array, then an empty array is returned.

**end (optional)**-> denotes till which index (excluding) you want to extract from the start,

- If `end` is omitted, then its treated as array.length
- If end is negative then it is treated as array.length-end
- If end is non-negative & less than start, then empty array is returned
- If end is greater than length of an array, then it is treated as array.length

Lets see some of the examples,

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.slice(); //returns [1,2,3,4,5]
arr.slice(2); //returns [3,4,5]
console.log(arr); //[1,2,3,4,5]

arr.slice(2, 1); //returns []
console.log(arr); //[1,2,3,4,5]

arr.slice(2, -1); //returns [3,4], here end is treated as arr.length-1 which is 4 i.e arr.slice(2,4)
console.log(arr); //[1,2,3,4,5]

arr.slice(2, 9); //[3,4,5]
console.log(arr); //[1,2,3,4,5]
```

Using slice we can also convert an array like objects to an array ?
Syntax:

```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```

example,

```js
let array_like_obj = {
  0: "john",
  1: "doe",
  2: "capscode",
  length: 3,
};
console.log(Array.prototype.slice.call(array_like_obj));
//["john", "doe", "capscode"]
```
