Hello Devs,

In this blog you are going to learn how split works in JavaScript.
and how to use split efficiently in your next project.

let str="javascript"

console.log(str.split("")[0])

console.log(str.split()[0])

console.log(str.split("")[0])

//If an empty string ("") is passed as an argument, the string is split between each characters.

console.log(str.split()[0])

//if nothing is passed as argument then array is returned with one element and that element will be str
