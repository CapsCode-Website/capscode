# VS Code Extension List <a name="vscodeextensionlist"></a>

## 1. Prettier

This is the most famous and used extension in vs code.
This extension is used to format the code which means when we write codes we sometimes didn't consider line breaks or brackets after a space and some of the stuff like this. This extension automatically beautifies your code and makes it clean and more readable.

It supports lots of programming languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Flow, JSX, JSON, CSS, SCSS, Less, HTML, Vue, Angular, GraphQL, Markdown etc.

## 2. ToDo Highlight

Sometimes when we write code lots of ideas and logic runs through our minds and we use to write those ideas as a comment in the code block and again after a few days if we want to recall them it's pretty difficult to find them within the code.
So this extension comes with a wonderful feature of highlighting certain keywords within the code like NOTE, TODO and FIXIT and also it provides a feature to customize the keywords and their background, foreground and text color.
To customize the keywords and other stuff, command + , (Windows / Linux: File -> Preferences -> User Settings) and open the vscode file settings.json.
